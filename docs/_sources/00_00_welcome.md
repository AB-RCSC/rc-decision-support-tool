## üì∑ How does it work!?
This tool aims to support your decision-making process when designing a remote camera program by guiding you through a series of decision points related to your study in the form of an interactive flow chart. At each step, users will be able to access information related to the question itself, the impacts of the various choices on study design, or important related topics via ‚Äúpop-up‚Äù boxes; information tabs include multiple tabs for information in different levels of complexity (new vs. advanced user) and formats (e.g., descriptions, figures, videos, Shiny apps, etc.).

Once you have answered all of the questions, study design **recommendations will be generated from your selections as a standardized report**, which will include:
a) appropriate modelling approach(es) (e.g., density ‚Äì spatially explicit capture-recapture),
b) study design recommendations (e.g., camera spacing, number of cameras, etc.), and 
c) analysis considerations (e.g., variables to consider in your analysis to reduce bias).

```

At each step, you will be able to access information related to the question in the ‚Äúinfo-popups‚Äù that include tabs with information explained with different levels of complexity (overview vs. advanced) and accessible formats (e.g., figures, videos, Shiny apps, etc.), as well analytical tools and resources. Click on the next dropdown to learn more.
